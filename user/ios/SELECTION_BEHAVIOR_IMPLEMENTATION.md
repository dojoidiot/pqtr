# Improved Selection Behavior Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the improved selection behavior that makes image interaction more intuitive and iOS-friendly, following the exact specifications provided.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Selection Store (`src/store/selectionStore.ts`)
- **New Methods**:
  - `enter()`: Turn on select mode
  - `exit()`: Turn off select mode + clear selections
  - `select(id)`: Add single ID to selection
  - `toggle(id)`: Toggle selection state
  - `clear()`: Clear selections but keep mode state
  - `set(ids)`: Set multiple IDs and update mode

### 2. Updated ImageCard Component (`src/components/gallery/ImageCard.tsx`)
- **New Props**:
  - `selecting`: Boolean indicating if in selection mode
  - `onTap`: Single tap behavior (decided by parent)
  - `onLongPress`: Long press to enter select + select item
- **Behavior Changes**:
  - Selection checkmarks only show when `selecting` is true
  - Filename overlays only show when `selecting` and `selected`
  - Improved accessibility with proper labels and roles

### 3. Updated GalleryGrid Component (`src/components/gallery/GalleryGrid.tsx`)
- **New Props**:
  - `selecting`: Selection mode state
  - `onSelectFirst`: Handler for long-press (enters select mode + selects)
- **Smart Tap Logic**:
  - If NOT in selection mode → opens detail
  - If in selection mode → toggles selection
- **Long Press**: Enters selection mode and selects the pressed image

### 4. Updated StickyActionBar Component (`src/components/gallery/StickyActionBar.tsx`)
- **New Props**:
  - `selecting`: Selection mode state
  - `onDone`: Exit selection mode
- **Dynamic Actions**:
  - **Selection Mode**: Shows "Done" button instead of "Clear"
  - **Normal Mode**: Shows standard Preset/Share/More buttons

### 5. Updated ProjectScreen (`src/screens/ProjectScreen.tsx`)
- **Selection Logic**:
  - Preset/Share with no selection: enters selection mode + shows helpful toast
  - Long press on image: enters selection mode + selects that image
  - Clear button: exits selection mode completely
  - Done button: exits selection mode when pressed

## User Experience Flow

### **Normal Mode (Not Selecting)**
1. **Tap Image** → Opens detail view
2. **Long Press Image** → Enters selection mode + selects that image
3. **Preset/Share (no selection)** → Enters selection mode + shows toast: "Tap photos to select. Long-press to add more."

### **Selection Mode (Selecting)**
1. **Tap Image** → Toggles selection (does NOT open detail)
2. **Long Press Image** → Adds to selection
3. **Action Bar** → Shows "Done" button to exit selection mode
4. **Preset/Share** → Opens respective sheets with selected images

### **Exiting Selection Mode**
- Press "Done" button in action bar
- Press "Clear" button (exits completely)
- Navigate away from screen

## Key Benefits

### **Predictable Behavior**
- Tap always opens detail when not selecting
- Tap always toggles selection when selecting
- No accidental detail opening during selection

### **Intuitive Entry Points**
- Preset/Share buttons naturally lead to selection mode
- Long press provides quick selection entry
- Clear visual feedback for current mode

### **iOS-Friendly Patterns**
- Consistent with iOS selection behavior
- Clear mode indicators
- Easy exit from selection mode

## Technical Implementation Details

### **State Management**
```typescript
// Selection store provides clean API
const sel = useSelection();
sel.enter();    // Enter selection mode
sel.exit();     // Exit + clear
sel.select(id); // Add single item
sel.toggle(id); // Toggle selection
```

### **Smart Tap Handling**
```typescript
onTap={() => {
  // If NOT in selection mode → open detail
  // If in selection mode → toggle selection
  selecting ? onToggleSelect(item.id) : onOpenDetail(item.id);
}}
```

### **Toast Notifications**
- Helpful tips when entering selection mode
- Clear instructions for user actions
- Consistent with overall UX patterns

## Files Modified
- `src/store/selectionStore.ts` - Enhanced selection state management
- `src/components/gallery/ImageCard.tsx` - New selection behavior
- `src/components/gallery/GalleryGrid.tsx` - Smart tap handling
- `src/components/gallery/StickyActionBar.tsx` - Dynamic action buttons
- `src/screens/ProjectScreen.tsx` - Selection logic orchestration

## Future Enhancements
- Haptic feedback for selection changes
- Selection count animations
- Batch operation improvements
- Drag and drop selection

The implementation successfully provides a clean, predictable, and iOS-friendly selection experience that eliminates confusion between opening details and selecting images.
