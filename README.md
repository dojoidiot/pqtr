# PQTR Project Repository

## Documentation Structure: The Apex Convention

This repository uses a **documentation-first approach** with the **apex.md convention** to provide clear, organized information for each project area.

## What is the Apex Convention?

Instead of scattered README files, each project area has a `doc/` directory containing an `apex.md` file that serves as the **primary entry point** for understanding that project area.  Apex was chosen as it most likely is the first file in the docs area.

## What should I do?
If you are a business level reader, read boss.md.  This provides the least technical summary of everything and its status.
If you are a technical reader, you should read info.md for the high level overview of the system and its components.
If you want to know the current todo list, read todo.md
