ok.

Does this make sense?

We are designing the zone root control process then moving it out to the control of the zone head.

Start from code and make the control keys.

* First thing is that on a linux desktop we load the source repo to access the code with the host scripts. 
* We run the script called "zone-make.sh" which creates the root zone keys locally.
* We eund user-make and user sign to create a trusted user set of keys that is delegated env access by the zone keys to nodes for full control.  
* A cloud server is provisioned with root access and password.
* That cloud server is hardened with node-make.sh
* Then that first node is selected as the zone-head and so we run a script called zone-init.sh which then using the trusted user takes the local zone root information, moves it to the zone head under control of the key management on that node, and it does the work to become the zone head. 
* Then that head is used with all your suggestions to be the head of the zone to manage from there.
* How does that sound and what needs to be done in a script to manage from there?
